#JSON::Jansson

This is a basic Perl 6 binding to libjansson: a C library for manipulating JSON data.

Still pretty rough! While JSON::Jansson objects attempt to emulate P6 hashes or arrays, they don't have all the same capabilities.

JSON::Jansson is an appropriate choice if you're willing to trade features for
speed. While JSON::Tiny is much more flexible and powerful, JSON::Jansson is
(comparatively) fast.

As an example: `examples/big.json` is approximately 10mb, generated by
[json-generator](json-generator.com).  JSON::Jansson parsed it 
in about 2 seconds, while JSON::Tiny took a little over four minutes. Note that
this is still slower than Perl 5's JSON::XS, which parses such a workload in
under a second.  NB: The usual disclaimers about lies and benchmarks apply -- 
this was an ad-hoc comparison run off a busy laptop.


### SYNOPSIS

    use JSON::Jansson;
    my %object = from-json('{"foo": ["a", 42, {"bar": "deep nesting"}]}');
    my $str = to-json({foobar => [99, "lollipop"]});

### TODO

0. don't leak memory (decref JSON pieces that are DESTROYed) -- made trickier by jansson using macros to define the decref functions, which NativeCall can't see.
1. tests
2. decide if the methods to interface with jansson objects directly make sense to keep
